From a young age my mother said, "If you're going to take risks, do so while you're young & you still can"!

Due to my mother's advice, I chose to go high risk in the music industry in lieu of entering a more traditional route from the age of 18 to 28. During this time, I learned about the Music business, marketing, branding, managing advertisement campaigns, influencer marketing, and gained a passion in entrepreneurship. After scaling my brand to making me a living wage as a performing Dj. I shifted my attention to helping other serious artists be empowered to do the same by teaching them what I know. While I lived in Los Angeles, my roommate a Senior Software Engineer noticed my passion in entrepreneurship & problem solving, and rather convincingly talked me into picking up technology as a bridge to help me continue to solve problems. But, rather than focusing on artist I would now focus in on companies. The dots connected! I had finally found something out side of music that would create a stable future for myself and would still allow me to find just as much satisfaction as I found as an artist. Since, I've been in Lambda School picking up the skills, working on personal projects, and continuing to develop my skills as a life long learner. As of this moment I can provide value to companies with my skills in Html, Css, Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Knex, Express, Mysql, postgres, and python.

• My areas of expertese include: Html, Css, Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Knex, Express, Mysql, postgres, python, marketing, & branding.

• My passions of course includes coding. But, helping businesses & artists alike solve their business issues is also what makes me tick. I am still pursuing my interest in business, music, & personal development. In this process I am hoping to acquire not only successes & wins but knowledge which will help me bring additional value to any where I may find my skills being acquired. These are my north stars and what makes me, me! 

• I have recently become very interested in learning as much as possible about finances & real estate. I hope that having a solid financial plan will some day contribute to my success in business or helping other business men or women be successful. However, I'm always a student first!
