  With over a year of experience as a full-stack software engineer, I have developed a strong skill set and a passion for problem-solving. I am proficient in front-end technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Ember.js, Handlebars.js, and fastboot.js, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, Knex, Strapi, and PostgreSQL. I am also certified in full-stack web development and scrum master by Lambda School and Scrum Alliance, respectively.

  Previously, I was a software engineer at Upsie Technologies, where I participated in a rewrite of the entire front-end during a company rebrand, taking charge of the front-end styling practices and developing best practices for maintaining SEO standards. I have also assisted in the development of new features and applications using various technologies. Previously, I was an associate product lead at Lambda School, where I communicated team progress to stakeholders, managed resources, and supported teams as they transitioned in and out of labs. I also held leadership roles as a section lead and a team lead at Lambda School, where I managed a cohort of 150 students and provided daily feedback and support to instructors and students. In addition, I am a US Army veteran, where I served as a motor transport operator and an automated logistical specialist for over six years.

I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and develop as a software engineer and am excited to contribute to teams and projects that align with my skills and goals. I value collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, and I strive to apply these values in my work.
